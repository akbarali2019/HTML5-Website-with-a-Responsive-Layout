          <p>The Tour Company prides itself on the quality of service and the attention that is given to all our clients no matter what the level of business. The company has employed the same ‘core’ staff for several years meaning that we are all familiar with each others clients and are able to help if “instant gratification” is needed and your agent isn’t available. Our staff are experienced, well-traveled and have years of travel knowledge among them. They draw upon their own first-hand experiences when customizing vacations for you.</p>
          <p>Many agencies force you to deal with multiple people throughout the booking process, making it disjointed and impersonal. At Mochi TourGuide you will deal with the same travel expert from the moment of initial contact until you are safely back at home. At Mochi TourGuide, we strive to earn repeat business from you and want you to recommend us to your friends and family. Your referrals are extremely valuable to us and we know that we have to work diligently to deserve them.</p>
